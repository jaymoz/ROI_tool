## Installation

To run AROhI, we need to install Python 3 environment. The current version has been tested on Python 3.10. It is recommended to install a Python virtual environment for the tool. Below are step-by-step instructions to setup the environment and run the tool.

### Environment Setup

1. Clone this repository and move to the directory:
   ```python 
    python3 -m venv venv
    cd 2023
    ```
3. Run this on command line to create and activate a virtual environment
   ```python 
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. 

* To run React App @ localhost:3000
  - npm start - to start the React App
  - npm install - install all the dependencies
* To run Flask App @ localhost:5000
