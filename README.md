# AROhI

## Installation

To run AROhI, we need to install Python 3 environment. The current version has been tested on Python 3.10. It is recommended to install a Python virtual environment for the tool. Below are step-by-step instructions to set up the environment and run the tool.

### Environment Setup

1. Clone this repository and move to the directory:
   ```python 
    cd 2023
    ```
2. Run this on the command line to create and activate a virtual environment
   ```python 
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install all the dependencies and run React App @ localhost:3000
   ```js
    cd client
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
4. To run Flask App @ localhost:5000
   ```python
    cd backend
    python3 application.py
    ```
   Make sure no other application runs on any of these two hosts. The website has been programmed to run on localhost:3000 and localhost:5000 automatically.

5. The dataset for testing the tool is accessible in the dataset folder of the repository.
